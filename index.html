        <p> Hi! I'm a very passionate artist and hobbyist who almost never gets tired of making all sorts of curious things. Right now, I'm working
            on myself while also trying to tackle various projects that are W.I.P.s (works in progress) as a Software Engineering major at BYU-I.
            I'm a really bubbly, excitable person who loves to share the love and support I've been given so far in all sorts of ways, and hope to
            be able to live a comfortable, cozy life with my friends, family, and so on!

        </p>

            I've moved all over, but for most of my life I've lived in Maricopa, Arizona with my parents, 3 siblings, and have been having about as much fun 
            as I can while having to acclimate to higher and lower temperatures rapidly. Though, it's totally worth it because I get to be with the people I 
            love as well as my feathered friends, which are all my parrots back home! Beyond that, I have so many dreams that I'll do my best to make come true, 
            like making my very own video game, and I can't wait to see what I'll be able to do in the future with the skills I get from this class!
        </p>
